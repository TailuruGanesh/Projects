gene expression, cell viability data, and drug labels

Gene Expression:
-the process by which the information encoded in a gene is turned into a function

Cell Viability:
-Cell viability is a measure of the proportion of live, healthy cells within a population

-There are three categorical features; cp_type, cp_time and cp_dose

inhibitor - inhibitor is a substance that slows or blocks the action of an enzyme

antagonist - antagonist is a substance that stops the effect of another substance

agonist - agonist is a substance that mimics the actions of a hormone or neurotransmitter, 
          and produces a response when it binds to a receptor in the brain.
